       <p class="sweet"> Today i wanna tell you about my trip to <strong>Interlaken</strong>.let me fist tell u about ths city. Interlaken is locaed in center of Switzerland and is famous for luxury whatches,parageliding and many more other activity but my <em><strong>amazing trip</strong></em> is not about those activity and it is about wild camping in the cottage.</p>
        <p class="sweet">
My stroy is begin we i met a girl in one fesival and after that we decided to travel together to some countries and we agreed to visit<strong> Interlaken</strong> fist with car. As many travelers know about the Switzerland, there are many villages which are <strong>not car friendly</strong> at all and the only way to reach there is by train! we decided to park our car in nearest parking and explore more villages around Interlaken and we started up to visit Bergen at first!         </p>
            <p class="sweet">
we headed to train station to buy train ticket but there were no ticket left! we were disappointment and of course there were enough reason for us to stop to go to Bergen but we agreed that it is amazing if we could climb up all the way. we should have been followed the main way but we did not and we chosed to get through the tough mountian and pass some forest in order to have a better view.</p>

             <p class="sweet">
Guess what?..Yes , we got lost and after 4 houres walking ,we have not reached anywhere. we were about to lose our hopes to find a place to stay until we saw really amazing cottage. At first we were really scared but we did dare and knock the door and out of sudden one girl pup up to the door with gun! we were almost dead but we did figure it out to talk to her and tell our story and she accepted to having us for a night,a night full of smile,dance and warm conversation, which was the cause of our unforgettable trip ever!it is always amazng to be spontaneous because you will never ever guess what amazing story is going to happen.  </p>
